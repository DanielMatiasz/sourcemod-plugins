# CNF sourcemod plugins
### By Meitis

This is just a collection of plugins I wrote for my CNF jailbreak server. Not all of them are finished, and some parts may look a bit strange since they have support for some future edits I was planning on making.
Database setup was done with some laravel migrations but since I'm not releasing my website part currently I won't be releasing that just yet.

These plugins are free to use/edit/distribute but just make sure I am set as plugin author in plugin's info (feel free to add your name to it as well though if you edit the plugin)
